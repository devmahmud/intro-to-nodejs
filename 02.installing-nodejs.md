# Installing Node.js

## For Windows

If you're running windows and not using WSL, I recommend you use the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/) from the Node.js site. Choose the latest LTS version.

## For everyone else

If you're not on windows or you are using WSL, I recommend using installing Node.js with [nvm (node version manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). NVM allows you to install many versions of Node.js at once and switch when you need. Also, NVM installs Node.js in a folder that will not have permission errors that you would otherwise run into with the official installer.

Once you have nvm installed, you need to install a Node version. You can download the latest LTS version with this command.

```bash
nvm install --lts
```
