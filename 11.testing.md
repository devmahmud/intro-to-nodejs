# Testing

One of the most common usecases for Node.js is writing test for Node.js and Frontend apps. Because Node.js can run outside the browser, it's perfect for CI environments and testing automations.

## Basic unit tests

Unit test will test little chunks of your code in isolation to ensure they behave as intended. Node.js ships with the `assert` module. This module gives us so many utilities that allow us to create expectations of on our code. When those expectations aren't met, assert will throw an error telling us why. This is perfect for testing!.

First let's create some code to test:

```js
// myLib.mjs
export const add = (num1, num2) => num1 * num2
```

Next let's write some assertions on this code

```js
// test.mjs
import assert from 'assert'
import { add } from './myLib.mjs'

try {
  console.log('add() should add two numbers ')
  assert.strictEqual(add(2, 5), 7)
  console.log('  âœ… passed')
} catch (e) {
  console.log('  ðŸš« fail')
  console.error(e)
}
```

Now run the test file with:

```bash
node test.mjs
```

You should get an output that describes how this assertion fails. Because our add function actually multiplies two numbers and instead of adding them. So either our tests is off or the code is wrong. Let's say the code is wrong, so lets fix that and run the test again and we should see that it passes now.

Assert is great but there are some amazing tools and libs built around it that make writing and reading tests satisfying. One of those tools that the comminity has adopted is called `jest`.
